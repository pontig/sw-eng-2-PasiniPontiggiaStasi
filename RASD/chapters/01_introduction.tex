\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
Software development is one of the most sought-after skills globally, and its growing importance is setted to persist in during future years.
The versatility of this ability allows solving many problems in different fields, including science, art, and entrepreneurship.
The acquisition of software development skills improves both creativity and innovation, as well as fosters the development of fundamental skills such as problem-solving, logical thinking, and effective communication.

To understand and master software development, it is essential to have the ability to design, write, and test software programs.
Dedication and patience are necessary for the gradual process of learning programming.
Theory is a foundational element, but it is only the start of developing your skills. Consistent practice is necessary to master concepts and programming techniques.

\subsection{Purpose of the document}
The aim of this document is to give a comprehensive explanation of the requirements and specifications for the project.
Functional and non-functional requirements are provided, with a focus on real possible use cases, end user interaction, and system limits and constraints.

Those who will read this document include end users who are primarily interested in a high-level description of the features
and developers who must implement the requirements presented in this document.

\subsection{Purpose of the product}
The purpose of the product is to provide a solution to the problem previously highlighted.
The \textbf{C}ode\textbf{K}ata\textbf{B}attle project, or CKB, is a platform that assist students in enhancing their software development abilities through battles.
Students in teams participate in programming exercises where they complete software projects following a test-first approach.
Creating battles, setting rules, and evaluating students' performance are tasks that educators do.
CKB promotes skill development, competition, and evaluation, fostering a collaborative and skill-building atmosphere.

\section{Scope}
CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a platform that allows students to improve their software development skills by participating in coding challenges.
Educators create coding battles within specific tournaments, encouraging students to improve their programming proficiency.
Students compete in coding battles to solve programming exercises in their chosen language while adhering to the test-first approach.

Educators create a battle by uploading a programming exercise (also known as Code Kata), specifying the group size, registration and submission deadlines, and scoring parameters.
Once created, students can form teams that can be changed between different battles in the same tournament, register for the battle, and receive access to a GitHub repository containing the code kata.
They are required to fork the repository and automate their workflow through GitHub Actions.

The battle score ranges from 0 to 100 and is determined by both mandatory automated evaluation (test case pass rate, timeliness, source code quality) and optional manual evaluation (personal scores assigned by educators).
The platform updates the battle score as students commit their code, in this way students and educators can keep track of the battle's ranking.
Following the deadline for submission, educators perform an optional manual evaluation before sharing the final battle rank with participants.

All students on the CKB platform have a personal tournament score, which is the sum of their battle scores in that tournament.
This score is determined by CKB when educators close a battle, and it is accessible to all platform users.

When educators close a tournament, the final tournament rank remains available to all platform users.
Gamification badges, which educators can define when creating a tournament, reward students for their performance or achievement.

CodeKataBattle fosters collaborative coding challenges, helping students improve their software development skills while introducing competition and gamification elements to enhance engagement and recognition.

\section{Document Structure}
The structure of this RASD document follows six main sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction:}
          provides an overview of the problem at hand, the purpose of the document and
          the project, the scope of the domain, and introduces the main goals of the system as a solution.

    \item \textbf{Overall Description:}
          gives a general description of the system, going into more details about its main functions.
          The description is assisted with the help of UML diagrams, such as class, activity and state diagram.
          The domain assumptions of the examined world are then explained along with any dependencies and constraints.

    \item \textbf{Specific Requirements:}
          specifies the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.
          It includes use cases diagrams, descriptions of each use case, and related sequence diagrams.
          Finally, it provides a mapping of the requirements to both goals and use cases.

    \item \textbf{Formal Analysis Using Alloy:}
          contains Alloy models which are used for the description of the application domain and his properties,
          referring to the operations which the system has to provide and some critical aspects of the system.

    \item \textbf{Effort Spent:}
          keeps track of the time spent to complete this document.
          The first table defines the amount of hours used by the whole team to get important decisions and to make reviews,
          the other tables contains the individual effort spent by each team member.

    \item \textbf{References:}
          lists all the documents used and that were helpfull in drafting the RASD.
