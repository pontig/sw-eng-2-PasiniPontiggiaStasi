\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of CodeKataBattle (CKB).
It provides functional and non-functional requirements for the development of the system, including use cases, features, user interaction and system constraints. This document is addressed to the developers who have to implement the requirements and
could be used as an agreement between the customer and the contractors.

CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a new platform that helps students improve their software development skills by training with peers on code kata. Educators use the platform to challenge students by creating code
kata battles in which teams of students can compete against each other, thus proving (and improving) their skills and soft-skills : in fact working in a team is useful to learn soft-skills such as
communication and coordination.

A code kata battle is essentially a programming exercise in a programming language of choice (e.g.,
Java, Python). The exercise includes a brief textual description and a software project with build
automation scripts (e.g., a Gradle project in case of Java sources) that contains a set of test cases that
the program must pass, but without the program implementation. Students are asked to complete the
project with their code. In particular, groups of students participating in a battle are expected to follow
a test-first approach and develop a solution that passes the required tests. Groups deliver their
solution to the platform (by the end of the battle). At the end of the battle, the platform assigns scores
to groups to create a competition rank.

    \item \textbf{G2} \quad Allows Educators to challenge Students by create coding tournaments and battles.
    \item \textbf{Gi} \quad Allows Educators to track Students' knowledge about software development, evaluating the code written during battles and the overall score obtained in tournaments
    \item \textbf{Gi} \quad Allows Educators to customize battles defining specific rules, achivements that Students can obtain and evaluation modality.
    \item \textbf{Gi} \quad Allows Students to improve their soft skills, as communication, collaboration and time management, by creating teams for coding battles
