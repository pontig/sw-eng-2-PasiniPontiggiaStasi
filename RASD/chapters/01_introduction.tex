\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
Software development is one of the most sought-after skills globally, and its growing importance is set to persist during future years.
The versatility of this ability allows solving many problems in different fields, including science, art, and entrepreneurship.
The acquisition of software development skills improves both creativity and innovation, as well as fosters the development of fundamental skills such as problem-solving, logical thinking, and effective communication.

To understand and master software development, it is essential to have the ability to design, write, and test software programs.
Dedication and patience are necessary for the gradual process of learning programming.
Theory is a foundational element, but it is only the start of developing your skills. Consistent practice is necessary to master concepts and programming techniques.

\subsection{Purpose of the product}
The purpose of the product is to provide a solution to the problem previously highlighted.
The \textbf{C}ode\textbf{K}ata\textbf{B}attle project, or CKB, is a platform that assists students in enhancing their software development abilities through battles.
Students in teams participate in programming exercises where they complete software projects following a test-first approach.
Creating battles, setting rules, and evaluating students' performance are tasks that educators do.
CKB promotes skill development, encourages healthy competition, and facilitates assessment, fostering an environment that encourages collaboration and enhances competencies.

\section{Scope}
CKB is a platform that allows students to improve their software development skills by participating in coding challenges.
Educators create coding battles within specific tournaments, encouraging students to improve their programming proficiency.
Students compete in coding battles to solve programming exercises in the defined programming language while following a test-first approach.

Educators create tournaments and battles by uploading a programming exercise (also known as Code Kata), defining group size limits by specifying both minimum and maximum participants, registration and submission deadlines, and scoring parameters.
Once a battle is created, students can form teams, a team is a group of students that follows the size boundaries defined, if no minimum is established CKB accepts teams formed by only one person.
Each team can be changed between different battles in the same tournament, and so also in different tournaments. 
When the registration deadline for the battle has expired, each team receives access to a GitHub repository containing the Code Kata.
They are required to fork the repository and an automatic workflow through GitHub Actions, so from this point, students can work on their code.

The battle score ranges from 0 to 100 and is determined by both mandatory automated evaluation (test case pass rate, timeliness, source code quality) and optional manual evaluation (personal scores assigned by educators).
The platform updates the battle score as students commit their code to GitHub, in this way students and educators can keep track of the battle's ranking.
Following the deadline for submission, educators can perform an optional manual evaluation, if previously defined, before sharing the final battle rank with all the participants.

Each enrolled student in the tournament is assigned a personal score, calculated as the sum of their battle scores within it.
This score is determined by CKB when educators close a battle, and it is accessible to all platform users.
When educators close a tournament, the final tournament rank remains available to all platform users.

Educator allows other colleagues to create battles within the context of a tournament.
Educators can create gamification badges, which can be used in tournaments to reward students for their performance or achievement.

\section{Document Structure}
The structure of this RASD document follows six main sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction:}
          provides an overview of the problem at hand, the purpose of the project, 
          the scope of the domain, and introduces the main goals of the system as a solution.

    \item \textbf{Overall Description:}
          gives a general description of the system, going into more detail about its main functions.
          The description is assisted with the help of UML diagrams, such as class, activity, and state diagrams.
          The domain assumptions of the examined world are then explained along with any dependencies and constraints.

    \item \textbf{Specific Requirements:}
          specifies the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.
          It includes use case diagrams, descriptions of each use case, and related sequence diagrams.
          Finally, it provides a mapping of the requirements for both goals and use cases.

    \item \textbf{Formal Analysis Using Alloy:}
          contains Alloy models which are used for the description of the application domain and its properties,
          referring to the operations that the system has to provide and some critical aspects of the system.

    \item \textbf{Effort Spent:}
          keep track of the time spent to complete this document.
          The first table defines the amount of hours used by the whole team to make important decisions and to make reviews,
          the other tables contain the individual effort spent by each team member.

    \item \textbf{References:}
          lists all the documents used and that were helpful in drafting the RASD. \\
