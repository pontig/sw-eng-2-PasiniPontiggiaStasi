> CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a new platform that helps students improve their software development skills by training with peers on code kata1 . Educators use the platform to challenge students by creating code kata battles in which teams of students can compete against each other, thus proving (and improving) their skills.

## Overview

This repository houses the CodeKataBattle (CKB) platform, a tool designed to help students enhance their software development skills through collaborative coding challenges. Educators create tournaments and battles, allowing students to compete and improve their coding abilities. The platform includes features such as GitHub integration, automated scoring, real-time updates, and gamification through badges.
